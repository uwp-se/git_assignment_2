# CSCI 475 - Git Assignment 2
By: TA Zoli Nahoczki | nahoczki@uwp.edu

### Introduction:
Git is a very important topic to understand when going into the software engineering
world. It is used to hold all of our code and ensure all of our versions are tracked.

A resource to help understand how git commits and branching works I would
recommend running through some of the “learngitbranching” site:
https://learngitbranching.js.org/

Along with this, Github provides us with a platform to use git and store our code in the
cloud. Github has a feature where developers can create a pull request and allow
developers to review that request before merging into a branch

### Description:
I have created a repo for everyone to use. The objective is to create a new branch
(branched off develop) with the naming scheme “hw/GITHUB_ID” (replace GITHUB_ID
with your github name) and make a commit or two (you can edit or make new files) then
push your branch up. After pushing your branch up you will open a pull request into the
develop branch.

Also after opening your pull request, make a review on someone else’s pull request but
do not merge.

So, TODO:
- Clone the repo
- Create new branch (“hw/GITHUB_ID”)
- Modify files or add files and commit
- Push changes & branch to remote
- Open a pull request
- Review someone else’s pull request


### Submission:
You will be turning in the final product of the above description.

Items graded will be: your branch, pull request, and review
